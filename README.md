# Identicon Generator — Vibes Disclaimer

## TL;DR

This project was vibecoded with AI. It is not serious, not polished, and definitely not pretty under the hood, but it does work, and that is kind of the point.

## What This Is

This identicon generator exists because I was bored, curious, and messing around with AI-assisted coding.

I took:

* Some existing Ruby code I had lying around from another project
* A few AI prompts
* A questionable amount of trust in the vibes

And somehow ended up with a single HTML file that generates identicons.

At that point I figured: "Why not throw this on GitHub Pages and let people use it?"

So here we are.

## What This Is Not

Let us be clear:

* This is not a production-grade project
* This is not an example of clean or idiomatic code
* This is not something I would submit to a job interview

The code is atrocious in places. I know it. You know it. The AI definitely knows it.

Most of it was stitched together in just a couple prompts, with logic ported, mutated, and duct-taped into place until it worked.

## Why It Exists Anyway

Even though it started as a joke or boredom project, it turned out to be:

* Actually kind of useful
* Easy to host for free
* Fun to share

So instead of deleting it, I leaned into the chaos and shipped it.

## Philosophy

This project follows a very strict development methodology:

**All vibes. No pressure.**

If it breaks, that is on the vibes. If it works, also the vibes.

## Final Notes

If you find this useful, awesome. If you inspect the source and cringe, understandable. If you improve it, even better.

This is just a fun little identicon generator born from boredom, AI, and questionable decisions.

Nothing serious. All vibes.
